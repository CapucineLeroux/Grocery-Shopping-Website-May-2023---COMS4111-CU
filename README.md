## Website to do grocery shopping online

### Description

This project aimed at implementing a website to do grocery shopping online using our own designed database. The project required some SQL queries, and some Python programming to code a Flask app.

### How to use the code

1. Launch the server (open a terminal, execute server.py using a command such as 'python3 server.py')  
2. The terminal should print a URL, copy and paste it to your web browser.  
3. The grocery shopping website should load in your web browser, ready for use. Don't forget that every modification you make such as creating an account will modify the database (fast_food_database.db).
